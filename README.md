# GAN Traffic Sign Generation Project

This project uses Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate traffic sign images. This involves training a generator and a discriminator on the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) dataset.

## Setup

First, ensure you have TensorFlow installed and other required libraries:

```bash
pip install tensorflow matplotlib imageio
