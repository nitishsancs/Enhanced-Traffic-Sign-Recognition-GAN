# Project Title: GANs for Generating Traffic Sign Images

This project demonstrates how to use Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate images of traffic signs. The project is implemented using TensorFlow and trains on the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) dataset.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or later
- TensorFlow 2.x
- IPython
- Matplotlib
- Numpy
- ImageIO
- PIL

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

git clone <repository-url>

2. Install required Python packages:

pip install tensorflow matplotlib numpy imageio pillow

3. Navigate to the project directory:

cd path_to_project


### Running the Project

- Execute the main script to start training the model:

python train_model.py



## Project Structure

- `train_model.py`: This script contains the entire training logic for the GAN, including model definitions, data loading, and training loop.
- `images/`: Directory where generated images will be saved during training.
- `training_checkpoints/`: Directory where training checkpoints will be stored.

## Training Data

The model is trained on the GTSRB dataset. The dataset should be placed in the `/content/Train` directory after downloading and unzipping.

## Output

After training, the model will generate images of traffic signs, which will be saved in the `images/` directory. A GIF of the training progress can be found in the project directory.

### Load and prepare the dataset

You will use the MNIST dataset to train the generator and the discriminator. The generator will generate handwritten digits resembling the MNIST data.

### Create the models

Both the generator and discriminator are defined using the [Keras Sequential API](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras#sequential_model).

### The Generator

The generator uses `tf.keras.layers.Conv2DTranspose` (upsampling) layers to produce an image from a seed (random noise). Start with a `Dense` layer that takes this seed as input, then upsample several times until you reach the desired image size of 28x28x1. Notice the `tf.keras.layers.LeakyReLU` activation for each layer, except the output layer which uses tanh.

### The Discriminator

The discriminator is a CNN-based image classifier.

### Define the loss and optimizers

Define loss functions and optimizers for both models.

### Save checkpoints

This notebook also demonstrates how to save and restore models, which can be helpful in case a long running training task is interrupted.

### Define the training loop

The training loop begins with generator receiving a random seed as input. That seed is used to produce an image. The discriminator is then used to classify real images (drawn from the training set) and fakes images (produced by the generator). The loss is calculated for each of these models, and the gradients are used to update the generator and discriminator.

### Generate and save images

Generate and save images function is used during training to save generated images at various epochs to visualize the progress.

### Train the model

Call the `train()` method defined above to train the generator and discriminator simultaneously.

### Restore the latest checkpoint

Restore the latest checkpoint in the training directory (`./training_checkpoints`).

### Create a GIF

Use `imageio` to create an animated gif using the images saved during training.
